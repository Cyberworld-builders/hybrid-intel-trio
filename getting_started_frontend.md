## Notes 
- need to upgrade npm
    - `npm install -g npm@11.3.0`
- i created the repo first so i'll need to run create react app in the existing directory
    - `npx create-react-app .`
    - needed to force
        - `npx create-react-app . --force`
    - still giving issues.
        - moved the markdown file temporarily to get through the process. i just want to keep moving forward.
- react scaffolding is up
